### Overview

We've organized for you to complete a client project. This is a great opportunity for you to be exposed to a **real organization** doing **real work** with **real data**.

**The Organization**:

- [New Light Technologies](https://newlighttechnologies.com/) is a small, award-winning organization based in Washington, D.C. that provides solutions to government, commercial, and non-profit clients. NLT is a team of dedicated technologists, scientists, engineers, designers, and strategists working on some of the most interesting, challenging, and important assignments in the world, ranging from disaster response to enabling growing telecommunications networks to providing healthcare to Americans. Some of the organizations they work with include FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), USAID (the United States Agency for International Development), the U.S. Census Bureau, and The World Bank.

- [Ran Goldblatt](https://newlighttechnologies.com/staff/ran-goldblatt/), our contact with NLT, is a remote sensing scientist and senior consultant. He has a strong background in geographic information systems (GIS) and leverages this knowledge when solving problems facing various agencies.

**The Work**:

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on: 
- preparing for emergencies,
- rapidly responding to emergencies, and/or 
- estimating the economic impact of disasters.

The goal is for you to leverage your skills to help solve real-world problems. NLT has identified twelve potential prompts of value to them. You 


*Problem Statement:*
The students will design and implement a web-tool or an app for rapid alert and notification about a disastrous event, in close to real time. The tool will alert about the event, similar, for example, to earthquake or tsunami warnings that appear on Google's home page immediately after a major disaster. While traditional methods for alerting on such events rely on official information derived from official sources (e.g. USGS), this tool will utilize social media activity to identify these events and alert when an event first occurs.
